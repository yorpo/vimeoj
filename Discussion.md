- **package name:**
What should the package name be? I'm not really happy with "us.tryclickon", we could take one of mine ;-) - maybe we should ask vimeo, if we could take "vimeo.com". Or maybe "vimeoj.googlecode.com"

- **libraries:**
It would be nice if we could checkout the whole projects with all libraries. I'm not sure if it could be a problem with licenses.
